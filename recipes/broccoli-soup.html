<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>8 cups broccoli florets</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups milk</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender.</li>
    <li>Add broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.</li>
    <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to medium-low heat; stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
